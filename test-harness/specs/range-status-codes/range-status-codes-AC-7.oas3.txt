====test====
Scenario: no code is requested and the OAS doc has no 2XX status codes but does have a default
  Given I have an OAS 3 document with a listTeams operation
  And the listTeams operation has a range of 4XX response status codes defined
  And the listTeams operation has a default defined
  When I send a request to listTeams without specifying a preference for status code
  Then I should receive a response with the default example content and a status code of 200

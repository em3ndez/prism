====test====
Scenario: the requested code has no exact or range matches in the OAS doc but does have a default
  Given I have an OAS 3 document with a listTeams operation
  And the listTeams operation has a range of 5XX response status codes defined
  And the listTeams operation has a 503 status code defined
  And the listTeams operation has a default defined
  When I send a request to listTeams specifying a preference for a 401 status code
  Then I should receive a response with the default example content and a 401 status code

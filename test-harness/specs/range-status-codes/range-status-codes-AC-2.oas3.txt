====test====
Scenario: the requested code has no exact matches but does match a range of status codes in the OAS doc
  Given I have an OAS 3 document with a listTeams operation
  And the listTeams operation has a range of 5XX status codes defined
  And the listTeams operation has a 503 status code defined
  And the listTeams operation has a default defined
  When I send a request to listTeams specifying a preference for a 502 status code
  Then I should receive a response with the 5XX range example content and a status code of 502

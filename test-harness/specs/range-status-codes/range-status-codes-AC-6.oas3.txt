====test====
Scenario: no code is requested and the OAS doc has no exact 2XX status code but does have a 2XX range
  Given I have an OAS 3 document with a listTeams operation
  And the listTeams operation has a range of 2XX response status codes defined
  And the listTeams operation has a default defined
  When I send a request to listTeams without specifying a preference for status code
  Then I should receive a response with the 2XX example content and a status code of 200
